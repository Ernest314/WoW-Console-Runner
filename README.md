# WoW Console Runner

This is a simple container GUI for the two discord bots running
on our guild's server. Both of them are C# console apps (written
in DSharpPlus). Features include:

+ Stop/Run/Restart of either process
+ Displaying output of both processes
+ Logging of console output
+ Custom locations for bot .exe files

## [Irene][2]

A utility bot for the guild, written to be expandable with modules.
