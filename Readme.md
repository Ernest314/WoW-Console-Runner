# WoW Console Runner

This is a simple container GUI for running discord bots used on our
guild's server. Both of them are C# console apps (written in
DSharpPlus). Despite our specific use case, this program works to
host any console programs (.exe) which need to stay running.

Features include:

+ Stop/Run/Restart of each process
+ Displaying output of each process
+ Logging of console output (with timestamps)
+ Unlimited number of processes hosted at once
